/* 
BACKTRACKING ALGORITHM:
Backtracking is an alogrithmic technique for solving problem recursively by trying to build a solution
incrementally. Solving one piece at a time and remvoing those solutions which fail to satisfy the 
constraints of a problem at any point of time(by time, here , is referred to the time elapsed
till reaching any level of the search tree) it the process of backtracking

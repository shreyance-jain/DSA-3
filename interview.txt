The stock span problem is a financial problem where we have a series of n daily price quotes
for a stock and we need to calculate the span of stock’s price for all n days. 
The span Si of the stock’s price on a given day i is defined as the maximum number of
consecutive days just before the given day, for which the price of the stock on the
current day is less than or equal to its price on the given day.

For example, if an array of 7 days prices is given as {100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85},
then the span values for corresponding 7 days are {1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6}.

Given two strings s1 and s2. The task is to check if s2 is a rotated version of the string s1.
The characters in the strings are in lowercase.
